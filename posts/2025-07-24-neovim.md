# Why Neovim Is My Daily Driver

Neovim is fast, lightweight, endlessly customizable, and terminal-based — perfect for both distraction-free writing and serious coding. In this post, I’ll walk through my current setup and why it works.

## Key Plugins

- `telescope.nvim` – fuzzy finding
- `lualine.nvim` – status line
- `lazy.nvim` – plugin loader
- `treesitter` – syntax trees
- `catppuccin` – theme

## Benefits for Writers

- Instant launch
- No mouse required
- Markdown feels frictionless

That’s it — minimalism, performance, and total control.
