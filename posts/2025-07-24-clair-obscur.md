# Opinion Review: _Clair Obscur: Expedition 33_

_Clair Obscur: Expedition 33_ is, without question, one of the most compelling RPG experiences I've had in recent years. The game’s rich narrative, hauntingly beautiful score, and emotionally grounded character arcs make it a standout in the genre.

##  The Highlights

### Story & Characters

The story is _exceptionally well written_, with a sense of pacing that keeps you engaged throughout. Each character feels thoughtfully crafted, with personal arcs that are meaningful and emotionally resonant. There's real care put into the dialogue and world-building—something that’s all too rare in modern RPGs.

### Music

The soundtrack is breathtaking. From quiet, introspective piano pieces to sweeping orchestral arrangements during climactic battles, the music enhances every moment. It’s not just background noise—it’s part of the storytelling.

### Art & World Design

The game is visually stunning. Its painterly aesthetic and surreal, dreamlike environments make exploration a joy. Every frame feels like a living piece of artwork.

## The Criticisms

While _Expedition 33_ shines in most areas, a few technical aspects pull it back slightly:

- **Lip Sync & Animations**: These can occasionally feel like placeholders or default assets (maybe they are), lacking the polish found in the rest of the presentation. This sometimes results in awkward camera angles and visual misalignment that break immersion.
    
- **Platforming & Movement**: The movement system, particularly in platforming sections, feels a bit too floaty. It doesn’t ruin the experience but does make some traversal sections feel imprecise and clunky compared to the game’s otherwise high standards.
    

## Final Thoughts

Despite a few animation hiccups and some less-than-perfect movement mechanics, _Clair Obscur: Expedition 33_ delivers an unforgettable RPG journey. Its masterfully told story, evocative music, and beautifully realised world place it among the best narrative-driven RPGs in years.

Rating: 4/5
