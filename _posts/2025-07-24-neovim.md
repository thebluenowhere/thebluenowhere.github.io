Neovim is fast, lightweight, endlessly customizable, and terminal-based — perfect for both distraction-free writing and serious coding. In this post, I’ll walk through my current setup and why it works.

## Key Plugins

- `telescope.nvim` – fuzzy finding  
- `lualine.nvim` – status line  
- `lazy.nvim` – plugin loader  
- `treesitter` – syntax trees  
- `catppuccin` – theme  

## Benefits for Writers

- Instant launch  
- No mouse required  
- Markdown feels frictionless  

## My Dotfiles

That’s it — minimalism, performance, and total control.
