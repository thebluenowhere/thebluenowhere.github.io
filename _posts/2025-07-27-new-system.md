## `Intro`

In this brief writeup, I’ll share the specifications of my new computer built specifically for Linux, along with the reasons behind each component choice. This build is designed for gaming, self-development, and running virtual machines, ensuring optimal performance and compatibility with open-source software.

## `Choosing the Right Components`

### Motherboard: B850 AORUS ELITE WIFI7

When selecting the motherboard, I opted for the **B850 AORUS ELITE WIFI7**. One of the key reasons for this choice was its excellent support for Linux. Many motherboards can be hit or miss when it comes to compatibility, but this one has a solid reputation in the Linux community.

### Processor: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D

Going with the **AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D** was a no-brainer for me. AMD has made significant strides in Linux support over the years, and this processor is a testament to that. With its 8 cores and impressive multi-threading capabilities, it handles everything from gaming to running multiple virtual machines with ease.

### Memory: 64GiB Synchronous Unbuffered 6400 MHz

I decided to go with **64GiB of RAM**. This amount of memory is potentially overkill for my workflow, but I focused here on future proofing and working on the assumption I'll continue with multiple virtual machines and high memory tasks.

### Graphics: Navi 48 [Radeon RX 9070 XT]

For graphics, I chose the **Radeon RX 9070 XT**. One of the standout features of this GPU is its raw power, although it lags behind similar Nvidia products at this price point — I opted for AMD again because of the open source drivers and seamless compatibility. From *Elden Ring* to *Overwatch* to *Disco Elysium*, every game runs maxed out graphics with little effort.

## `Challenges Faced`

Throughout the building process, I struggled most with being confident about my thermal paste application and obsessing over the cable management. I did end up limiting my CPU with a heat threshold. During shader loading on Steam, I was hitting 96°C. I've now capped the temp manually in BIOS so that it won't exceed 80°C — for peace of mind.

This computer is not just a machine; it’s a tool that enhances my productivity and gaming experience, all while being built with Linux in mind.
